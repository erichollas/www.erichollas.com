source code for my personal portfolio website



First the files MV.js, initShaders.js, and webgl-utils.js were not written by me. These files came from Edward Angel's gethub page and come with his textbook on WebGL. The other files were written by myself.

The index.html file contains the code for my webpage, PortfolioStyle.css contains the code to format the webpage, and the gasket.js file contains the code to initialize WebGL and the javascript to display and animate the Sierpinkski Gasket to be rendered in the gl-canvas tag in the html code for the webpage.

Note that for the webpage to be displayed you will need the "www" in the web address.
