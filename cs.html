		<h1>Mathematics Education and Research</h1>
			<p>My B.S. degree was in Mathematics and a minor in Physics from The University of Texas at San Antonio. I also took a few graduate classes and did some work towards a thesis in the Mathematics department and Physics department at Texas Tech University.</p>
			<p>I loved every minute and every sleepless night studying math and physics. I would love to discuss any of the courses I took, from Classical Mechanics and Relativity to Algebraic Topology and Differential Geometry.</p>
		<br></br>
		<br></br>


		<h1>Computer Science Education</h1>
			<p>On the advice of professors at The University of Texas at Tyler, I took four computer science courses at Dallas County Community College Online to satisfy UT-Tyler's graduate program's admissions standards. These four courses included Data Structures and Computer Organization.</p>
			<p>While at UT-Tyler I took an interesting class called Research Methods. The class' focus was in the field of HCI (Human Computer Interaction), which is the common research area of professors at that school. In this class I learned quite a bit about UI/UX and about how professors go about researching this subject.</p>
			<p>Also at UT-Tyler I worked for two different professors for three separate classes. These classes were two introductory courses, one using Java and the other using C, and a course in Data Structures using Java (although I prefer my data structures in C++). It was good experience learning to give better constructive criticism about others' code.</p>
			<p>Part way through my only semester at UT-Tyler, recognizing that their program was mostly focused on Information Systems as opposed to Computer Science, I decided to pursue my own self-taught education (and save a little on student loans).</p>

		<h1>Passion for Textbooks</h1>
			<p>Over the years I have amassed a modest collection of textbooks. At any given time I will be reading through at least one textbook. Currently I just finished reading several chapters of the standard book on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&me=" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">algorithms</a> on Graph and pathfinding algorithms. As of now I am finishing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&me=" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading</a> as I do exercises in Graphs and pathfinding. (The links are to the textbooks on Amazon)</p>
			<p>In order to give a better description of what I have been doing I have made a list of the well-known textbooks I have been reading these past two years. This list is of links to these books on amazon so you might have a picture/description to go along with the title/author(s).</p>
			<p>This first list is of textbooks I have finished cover-to-cover.</p>
