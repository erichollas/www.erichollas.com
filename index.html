		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>Mathematics Education and Research</h2>
			<p>My B.S. degree was in Mathematics and a minor in Physics from The University of Texas at San Antonio. I also took a few graduate classes and did some work towards a thesis in the Mathematics department and Physics department at Texas Tech University.</p>
			<p>To put it simply, Calculus III inspired most of my time at these schools. In graduate school I enjoyed many sleepless nights studying the mathematical forms found in Differential Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Tensor Geometry and how these forms so naturally define the rules of physics, especially conservation laws. My thesis, by the direction of my professor's research area, was going to be on the properties and use of isometries between hyperbolic surfaces. The purpose of this research was to re-parametrize complicated surfaces that are not integrable to be integrable and maintain their geometric properties, particularly surfaces arising in partial differential equations. This mathematics research has implications in Relativistic, Lagrangian Dynamics, and the Calculus of Variations. Unfortunately I was unable to finish this thesis.</p>
		<h2>Passion for Textbooks</h2>
			<p>Over the years as a student I have amassed a modest collection of textbooks. I love getting and reading new texts every chance I get. At any given time I will be reading through at least one textbook. Currently I am rereading my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-3rd-Herbert-Goldstein/dp/0201657023" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">Classical Mechanics</a> book from graduate school. (The link is to the textbooks on Amazon)</p>
		<h2>Currently in Progress</h2>
			<p>I could go on all day about math and physics, but when it comes to works in progress the obvious one is becoming the best programmer possible! Hopefully you've noticed the spinning 3D-Sierpinski Gasket. This was more or less to show my intentions in using the margin on this site for an animation done in Javascript and WebGL. Thus, one project I have in the works is to update the rotating fractal with a game of some kind. But the most current work in progress is doing projects and becoming a better coder using the C# language.</p>

		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<h2>Games in Vulkan</h2>

			<h3>Vulkan Render Engine</h3>
			<p>The Vulkan Render Engine is a simple rendering engine (well, simple for Vulkan). The overall goal of this project was to make something reusable. One way I saw to accomplishing this was to make an object that acted as an interface between the render engine and whatever program implements it. This object is the GeometryManager class (Not a singleton object). This object is a vector containing the vertices and indices to be loaded into vertex and index buffers and all of the offset locations for each object within the vertex and index buffers. This object will be passed by reference to the render engine object in any implementation, and the manager will be used to create and re-create the vertex buffer, index buffer, the offsets for the dynamic uniform buffer, and the drawing-by-index function in the command buffer object.</p>
			<p>The source code for this project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/erichollas/Games-Using-Vulkan/tree/master/VulkanRenderEngine" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h3>Multi-threaded Minesweeper</h3>
			<p>As far as game mechanics, this clone of minesweeper will follow the classical game of minesweeper. This game is an instance of a game that implements the Vulkan Render Engine.</p>
			<p>The overall goal of this project was to implement multi-threaded algorithms in a game setting. I was inspired by a textbook called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading, by Anthony Williams</a> to design thread safe functions. This book goes much deeper than the usual issues that arise in multi-threading programming like data races, and it is also mindful of the memory space needed for each of the threads. Thus, this project made for a good exercise in implementing multi-threaded algorithms with regards to thread safety as well as each threadsâ€™ memory space.</p>
			<p>The source code for this project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/erichollas/Games-Using-Vulkan/tree/master/MultithreadedMinesweeper" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Where to find the callable function, two lambdas, and the rest of the multi-threaded code will be listed on the associated readme file for the project.</p>

			<h3>State Machine 3D-PONG</h3>
			<p>The game logic in this clone of PONG is the same from the classical game of PONG. This version is presented in 3D and is another game to implement the Vulkan Render Engine. However, the main goal of this project is to implement FSM's that communicate with one another. Unnecessary for pong.... perhaps, but an exercise nonetheless.</p>
			<p>The design of the FSMs follow the design described in chapter 2 of Mat Buckland's game AI text book, which can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">here</a>. The character classes inherit from a base class and contain a StateMachine object as a class member. The StateMachine object is a template class that runs the runCycle() method, or update() method, for their respective class object. The StateMachine object also handles the messages sent between characters via the Messanger, a static singleton class. The states are singletons that inherit from a base template class, and the states define the execute methods and onMessage events. In this implementation, the onMessage events are collisions between the paddle and ball characters and the score changes. All of these characters are added into the ChraracterManager object, which acts as the data structure of the characters. The CharacterManager will keep track of the uniform matrices for each character and run runCycle() function each pass through the main game loop.</p>

		<h2>This Portfolio Webpage</h2>
			<p>Obviously if you are reading this, then you are enjoying the design of my website. The source code that I wrote for this website, including the graphic on the left side, of the page can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/erichollas" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. But I must mention with special thanks to Edward Angel for the source code to initialize WebGL, which is free for download on the GitHub associated with his textbook on Interactive Graphics with WebGL. Edward Angel's textbook, which is sold <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Computer-Graphics-Top-Down-Approach/dp/0133574849" id="hyperLink" target="_blank">here</a>, is a fantastic textbook for the foundational mathematics used in most, if not all, rendering pipelines.</p>
